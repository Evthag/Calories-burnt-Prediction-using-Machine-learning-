**Calories Burnt Prediction using Machine Learning**

**Overview**

This project focuses on predicting the number of calories burnt during a workout based on a person’s biological and physical parameters such as age, height, weight, duration, and body temperature.

The model uses Python and several machine learning algorithms (like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) to determine which performs best in accurately predicting calorie expenditure.


**Project Objectives**

Load and explore workout and calorie datasets

Merge both datasets for model training

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships

Handle data leakage and remove correlated features

Train and evaluate multiple regression models

Compare model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)



**Tech Stack**

Language: Python

Libraries Used:

pandas – Data loading and manipulation

numpy – Mathematical and array operations

matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization

scikit-learn – Data preprocessing and model evaluation

xgboost – eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm for regression tasks
